        <p className="font-nunito text-sky-50 mt-10">
        Hello, I'm Harley, a passionate web developer with a unique blend of business acumen and technical expertise. My journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, which laid the foundation for my diverse career path. Over the years, I've accumulated a wealth of experience, from managing restaurants to founding and managing a successful car wash company. While I enjoyed every aspect of entrepreneurship, what truly ignited my passion was the art of crafting exceptional user experiences online.</p>
        <br />

        <p className="font-nunito text-sky-50 m-1">I discovered my calling when I founded my car wash company five years ago. Recognizing the importance of a strong online presence in today's digital landscape, I took it upon myself to create a website that not only represented our brand but also provided our customers with a seamless and intuitive booking experience. This website became a game-changer for our business, setting us apart in a competitive industry.</p>
        <br />

        <p className="font-nunito text-sky-50 m-1">Driven by a desire to expand my development experience, I embarked on a journey to become a full-stack web developer. I recently completed A Full-stack bootcamp where I honed my skills and gained proficiency in the MERN stack of technologies. Now, I'm eager to channel my passion and expertise into creating innovative web solutions that captivate users and drive business growth.</p>
        <br />

        <p className="font-nunito text-sky-50 m-1">When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you can find me exploring the latest web development trends, brainstorming creative solutions, and continually refining my craft. I'm excited about the endless possibilities that the world of web development offers and am dedicated to creating meaningful digital experiences. As a believer in life-long learning, I am always looking for new ways to learn and improve my skills. In addition to perusing a second bachelor's degree in I/O Psychology, I like to relax and read when I get some down time. Some of my favorite books have been Sapiens by Yuval Harari, The Tipping Point by Malcom Gladwell, How to Win Friends & Influence People by Dale Carnagie, and Principals by Ray Dalio.</p>
        <br />

        <p className="font-nunito text-sky-50 m-1">Let's connect and collaborate to bring your web development projects to life. Whether you're looking to enhance your online presence, streamline user interactions, or simply discuss the latest industry trends, I'm here to make it happen!</p>
        <br />

        <p className="font-nunito text-sky-50 m-1">Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to the opportunity to work together.</p>
